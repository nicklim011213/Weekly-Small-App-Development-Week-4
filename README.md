# AOTW_Week4

## Explanation and rules

AOTW is a recurring series I would like to try. The acronym stands for **App Of The Week**.
The premise is very simple: every week, I have a new assignment—an application of some sort.
The first few days are spent ensuring that the most basic functions of the app are acceptable.
This is the end goal. Once the main end goal has been reached, I add stretch goals.

**I must make at least one commit a day**, with the exception of Saturday and Sunday, which are optional.

## This week’s app is: :sparkles: a gate game in unity :sparkles:
The base goal is to create a gate game in unity.  
A gate game is where a player runs through a level, and   
passes through gates which increase or decrease the score.   
sometimes the scores can be players and a fight may take place at the end,  
of the level.  
**Stretch goals will be added here:**
